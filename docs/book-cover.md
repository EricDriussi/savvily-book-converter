# Book Cover

The book cover is added by using this command.

```latex
\ThisTileWallPaper{17.9cm}{23.5cm}{./resources/Codigo_Sostenible_Print.png}
```

This command generates a new page with a background image, so it is needed to be used between commands `\begin` and `\end`.

```latex
\begin{document}
  \ThisTileWallPaper{17.9cm}{23.5cm}{./resources/Codigo_Sostenible_Print.png}
\end{document}
```
